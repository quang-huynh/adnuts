\title{Run an MCMC using an ADMB model, return (1) the posterior
draws, MLE fits and covariance/correlation matrices, and some
MCMC convergence diagnostics using CODA.}
\usage{
sample_admb_nuts(dir, model, iter, thin, warmup, duration = NULL,
  init = NULL, chain = 1, par.names = NULL, seed = NULL,
  control = NULL, verbose = TRUE, extra.args = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dir}{(Character) A path to the folder containing
the model. NULL indicates the current folder.}

\item{iter}{(Integer) The number of draws after thinning and
burn in.}

\item{thin}{(Integer) Controls thinning of samples. Save every
thin value, such that 1 corresponds to keeping all draws,
and 100 saving every 100th draw.}

\item{warmup}{(Integer) How many samples to discard from the
beginning of the chain, *after* thining. The burn in period
(i.e., the first warmup*thin draws) should be at least large
enough to cover dynamic scaling.}

\item{init}{(Numeric vector) A vector of initial values, which
are written to file and used in the model via the -mcpin
option.}

\item{seed}{(Integer) Which seed (integer value) to pass
ADMB. Used for reproducibility.}

\item{verbose}{(Logical) Whether to print ADMB warnings and
other information. Useful for testing and troubleshooting.}

\item{extra.args}{(Character) A string which is passed to ADMB
at runtime. Useful for passing additional arguments to the
model executable.}

\item{mode.name}{(Character) The name of the model
executable. A character string, without '.exe'.}

\item{covar}{(Numeric matrix) A manually defined covariance
matrix (in bounded space) to use in the Metropolis-Hastings
algorithm.}

\item{mcdiag}{(Logical) Whether to use the \code{mcdiag}
feature. This uses an identity matrix for the covariance
matrix.}

\item{eps}{(Numeric) The size of the leapfrog jump in the
hybrid method, with smaller values leading to smaller but
more accurate jumps. Must be a positive value.}
}
\value{
Returns a list containing (1) the posterior draws, (2)
  and object of class 'admb', read in using the results read
  in using \code{read_admb}, and (3) some MCMC convergence
  diagnostics using CODA.
